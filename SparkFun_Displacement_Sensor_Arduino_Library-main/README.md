The single and dual axis digital flex sensors (also known as Angular Displacement Sensors) from Bend Labs have changed the way we think about flex sensors. This flex sensor has 0.1Â° precision, with a digital I<sup>2</sup>C interface, and an output rate of up to 500Hz, in a single or dual axis configuration. These are truly powerful sensors.

We've written a SparkFun Angular Displacement Sensor Arduino Library to make getting up and running with these sensors a snap. 

This library is based on the Hardware Abstraction Layer written by Bend Labs. If you have a platform that is not supported by this library consider using their [HAL](https://github.com/bendlabs).

The I<sup>2</sup>C address of the sensor is software configurable which means you can hookup over 100 on a single I2C bus!

Thanks to:

* coltonottley - Fixed many bugs and issues around detecting 1-axis sensor properly, proper 1-axis comm, better calibration and polling routines
* [aleixpb2](https://github.com/aleixpb2) - Fixed the bad/broken uncompilable code (oh dear!).
