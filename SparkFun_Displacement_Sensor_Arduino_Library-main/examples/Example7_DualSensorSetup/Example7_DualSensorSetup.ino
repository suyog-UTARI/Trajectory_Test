  Reading the one and two axis flex sensors from Bend Labs
  By: Nathan Seidle @ SparkFun Electronics
  Date: March 2nd, 2019
  License: This code is public domain but you buy me a beer if you use this
  and we meet someday (Beerware license).

  This example shows how read two sensors at the same time.
  This requires that you've already run the ChangeAddress example and
  set the address of one sensor to 45 (0x2D). The other sensor
  should remain at the default address of 19 (0x13).

  This example presumes you're using two 2-axis sensors but can be pared
  down to 1-axis sensors.

  This example uses software polling but checkout the Interrupts example
  to see how to check the DRDY pins.

  SparkFun labored with love to create this code. Feel like supporting open
  source? Buy a sensor from SparkFun!

  https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15244 (1-axis sensor)

  Hardware Connections:
  Use the SparkFun Qwiic Breadboard Jumper (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14425)
  to connect to the RedBoard Qwiic and the following pins on the ADS:
  SCL: Yellow wire on Qwiic cable
  SDA: Blue
  VCC: Red
  GND: Black
