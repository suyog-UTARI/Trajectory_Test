  Reading the one and two axis flex sensors from Bend Labs

  License: This code is public domain but you buy me a beer if you use this
  and we meet someday (Beerware license).

  This example shows how to change the I2C address of the sensor.

  SparkFun labored with love to create this code. Feel like supporting open
  source? Buy a sensor from SparkFun!
  https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15245 (2-axis sensor)
  https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15244 (1-axis sensor)

  Hardware Connections:
  Use the SparkFun Qwiic Breadboard Jumper (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14425)
  to connect to the RedBoard Qwiic and the following pins on the ADS:
  SCL: Yellow wire on Qwiic cable
  SDA: Blue
  VCC: Red
  GND: Black
